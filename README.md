<img src="assets/images/digital-marketing-meeting.jpg" width="600" height="400">

## Background
A client marketing agency, Horiseon, reached out in order to refactor the source code for their website to meet accessibility standards.  

Horiseon emphasized that accessibility is necessary in order to: 
* Make their webpage more accessible for people with disabilites.
* Increase optimization for search engines (SEO).

## Performance Objectives
Horiseon is looking for the final webpage to meet the following criteria:
1. WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements.
2. WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
3. WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes.
4. WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order.
5. WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title.
